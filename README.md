# Ship-Schedule-EOM
Ship Schedule, for tracking outgoing customer orders

This is a report which anybody can make based on the "Master" ship list. It creates an Excel workbook detailing all expected shipments, organized by product line. The program places the new workbook in the user's personal SharePoint folder, and it crafts an email (addressed to all stakeholders) with a link to the workbook. Stakeholders can comment on each line item, providing any necessary info.
